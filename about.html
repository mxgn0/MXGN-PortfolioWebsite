        <h2>Max Jänichen</h2>
        <p>I am Max, 3D Artist born 1995 in Saxony, Germany. 
            My Focus contains procedural physical simulations, motion design and contemporary art. 
            I started modeling and animating with Autodesk 3Ds Max and Maya at the age of 12. 
            I continued creating the first visuals like Covers, Intros or Advertising in Cinema4D together with the use of After Effects while i made my first steps in Photoshop and Illustrator. 
            After working for a small marketing agency and a few private client tasks in Saxony while studying Media-Informatics and interactive Entertainment i decided in 2018 to focus on more detailed designs, which were only able with Plugins in C4D and third-party-software. 
            Learning the powerful tool houdini in 2018 sensitized me for procedural content creation.</p>
